> You can ignore the message, or confirm the transaction by clicking the button at the bottom.

> You can do downtimes using
> `/westmarch downtime activity:<the activity> character:<your characters name> level:<your characters level>`
> There are currently three options. More may be added later.
> - Doing a job:
>  You get paid for your work, but with a low dice result, you may get scammed.
> - Crime:
>   High risk-High reward version of jobs. 
>   Fines are high, but you can get 3x as much as with honest work.

For DMs:
> - Get reward items and gold at end of game:
> `/westmarch reward xp:<the combined xp the party receives>`
> This will create a user selection menu in the #westmarch-logbook 
> After choosing, it will output the xp per player, and an item + gold each that the players receives.
> Players have the option to opt out of the item and get the full gp amount (displayed below xp per person)

> - Get a list of items with cost between two values
> `/getitemsinrange minimum:<lowest price the item can have> maximum:<highest price the item can have>`
> This returns all items in that price range. There may be more items than fit in a discord message, so there is a button to send the next message until all items are displayed.
